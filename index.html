        <p class="n3-text">	• Naixue’s Tea x Hatsune Miku<br/>
            The collaboration between Naixue’s Tea and Hatsune Miku, a globally iconic virtual idol, exemplifies the power of cross-industry IP partnerships. The campaign merged digital culture with tea consumption by launching limited-edition drinks like the "Berry Future Sparkle Cup" with holographic packaging and themed NFC music cards. Exclusive merchandise, including collectible character badges and stage-inspired acrylic stands, drove fan engagement, with social media buzz exceeding 230 million impressions. The collaboration boosted Naixue’s daily sales by nearly quarter and expanded its audience, attracting more Gen-Z consumers and a variety of male customers—a rare demographic shift. By transforming tea into a cultural medium, Naixue reinforced its youth-centric branding while demonstrating how virtual IPs can bridge digital fandoms and real-world consumption situations.</p>

        <p class="n3-text">	• Dairy Queen x Chiikawa:<br/>
            The 2025 collaboration between DQ (Dairy Queen), a global ice cream giant, and Chiikawa , Japan’s breakout "healing economy" IP, merged whimsical desserts with fan-driven collectibles. Inspired by the beloved manga and anime characters—Chiikawa, Hachiware, and Usagi—DQ launched limited-edition treats like the "Lemon Cheesecake Waffle Crunch Blizzard" and themed cake ice creams, paired with collectible merchandise such as plush keychains, translucent cards, and fridge magnets. To amplify immersion, DQ opened six immersive theme stores and check-in stores nationwide, where fans could pose with life-sized character installations and redeem exclusive merchandise through purchases. The campaign capitalized on Chiikawa’s emotional resonance—its blend of adorable aesthetics and subtle "dark yet relatable" storytelling—to attract consumers seeking comfort in fast-paced urban life. Within days, the hashtag #DQChiikawa trended on Weibo, driving a about 30% surge in foot traffic and cementing DQ’s position as a pioneer in leveraging ACG culture for experiential retail.</p>

        <p class="n3-text">	• Dairy Queen x Blue Lock:<br/>
            Still DQ, but with Blue Lock—a high-stakes soccer anime centered on competitive youth training—transformed the ice cream brand into a hub for sports anime enthusiasts. Leveraging the series' adrenaline-fueled narrative, DQ launched limited-edition treats like the "Striker’s Chocolate Blizzard" with football-shaped toppings and "Blue Lock Freeze" blueberry slushies, packaged in dynamic black-and-blue cups featuring protagonist Yoichi Isagi. Themed stores mimicked the anime’s training facility, complete with locker-style seating and AR screens showcasing iconic match scenes. Fans could collect character cards and jersey-themed tumblers with purchases, contrasting with DQ’s earlier Chiikawa collab, which emphasized pastel aesthetics and plush collectibles219. While Chiikawa targeted fans seeking whimsical comfort, Blue Lock tapped into competitive manga's energy, broadening DQ’s appeal to more deep ACG fans who love anime and manga than only the group that likes cute little animals cartoons, cementing DQ's position in the choices of young people, especially young women, and boosting weekend sales—a testament to how IP-driven storytelling adapts to diverse audience psychographics.</p>

        <p class="n3-text">Yihetang, a prominent Chinese tea brand, has reimagined Water Margin—one of China's Four Great Classical Novels—through a dynamic fusion of heritage and modernity. This collaboration transforms the novel’s legendary heroes into contemporary pop culture icons, blending traditional storytelling with youth-centric aesthetics. The campaign introduces collectible character cards featuring stylized illustrations, distributed via themed tea purchases, alongside innovative packaging that reveals dynamic artwork through interactive cup sleeves. A story-driven mobile game further bridge classical narratives with digital engagement, while limited-edition beverages like rice wine pudding drinks merge cultural motifs with modern tastes.
            <br/>By integrating gaming, collectibles, and interactive experiences, Yihetang positions itself as a pioneer in revitalizing traditional culture for younger audiences. The collaboration not only drives sales but also elevates the brand’s cultural authority, showcasing how classical IPs can transcend time through creative reinterpretation. This strategy taps into Gen-Z’s appetite for nostalgia and novelty, transforming beverage consumption into a medium for cultural storytelling and community participation.</p>

            The collaboration showed a critically acclaimed sci-fi action mobile game, that exemplifies a groundbreaking fusion of gaming fandom and culinary creativity. Centered around the game's fifth anniversary, CoCo launched themed beverages like "Fresh Passionfruit Double Pop" and "Double Taro Milk Green Tea," inspired by the game's popular characters Lucia and Luna, with packaging designs reflecting their signature color aesthetics. Offline, CoCo transformed select stores into immersive hubs where staff greeted customers as the game's protagonist, fostering a sense of community among players. Exclusive merchandise, including character-themed cups and collectible badges, further amplified fan engagement.

        <p class="n2-text">What makes an “IP” attractive?</p>
        <p class="n3-text">A successful IP collaboration relies on a dynamic marketing strategy that seamlessly blends digital engagement with real-world experiences. Brands harness the power of platforms like Weibo, Rednote, and TikTok to build anticipation through teasers, behind-the-scenes content, and interactive campaigns. Influencers, particularly KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) and KOCs (Key Opinion Consumers), play a crucial role in amplifying reach by sharing exclusive previews and authentic experiences, creating a sense of community and excitement around the collaboration. Additionally, integrating subcultures such as anime, e-sports, and streetwear allows brands to connect with younger audiences on a deeper level, aligning products with their passions and lifestyles. This approach not only boosts relevance but also transforms the collaboration into a cultural phenomenon.</p>
        <img src="images/元素插图1.jpg" alt="元素插图1" style="max-width: 28%; height: auto; margin-right: 15%;"/>
        <img src="images/元素插图2.jpg" alt="元素插图2" style="max-width: 28%; height: auto;" />
        <p class="n3-text">Beyond the digital realm, offline experiences are equally vital in creating lasting impressions. Young consumers are often drawn to IP collaborations because they offer a sense of nostalgia or alignment with a subculture they identify with. This emotional connection can significantly increase product appeal and purchase intention. According to Washburn et al. (2000), co-branding enhances brand equity by leveraging complementary attributes, which increases perceived value. Pop-up stores and immersive themed events bring IP collaborations to life, offering fans a tangible connection to their favorite stories and characters. These spaces often feature limited-edition merchandise, live product launches, and interactive installations, turning a simple purchase into a memorable event. By combining digital storytelling with physical engagement, brands foster emotional connections that go beyond traditional marketing. This dual approach not only drives immediate sales but also builds long-term loyalty, positioning the brand as a cultural innovator in the eyes of its audience.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <p class="n2-text">What makes a good co-branding: The Brand Fit</p>
        <img src="images/元素插图4.jpg" alt="元素插图4" style="max-width: 20%; height: auto; float: left; margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%; margin-top: 1%;"/>
        <p class="n3-text">Consumer Behavior and Brand Loyalty: The research finds that co-branded products, particularly in the food and beverage industry, can foster stronger emotional ties between consumers and the brands involved. This emotional connection boosts brand loyalty and increases the likelihood of repeat purchases. These findings can be applied to explain why younger consumers are more likely to engage with IP co-branded beverage products.
            <br/>Market Penetration and Brand Synergy: Case studies demonstrates how cross-branding increases market reach and allows for deeper penetration in niche markets, especially those that align with specific cultural or subcultural trends. This insight can be used to highlight how IP collaborations allow beverage brands to tap into fanbases that might otherwise be difficult to reach. The perceived fit between the two brands plays a crucial role. Helmig et al. (2006) suggest that when the collaboration between brands is innovative and relevant, consumer attitudes are positively impacted, making the partnership more successful.</p>

        <p class="n3-text">Digital platforms like TikTok and Instagram are indispensable for spreading awareness about co-branded products. The ease of sharing content through these channels amplifies the success of co-branding campaigns. Short video formats and interactive features have proven particularly effective in reaching younger consumers.</p>

        <p class="n3-text">Welcome to the exciting world where your favorite drinks meet iconic pop culture! Discover how the concept of “Beverages + IP Products” has become a powerful trend, especially in the Chinese beverage market. New-style tea houses in China are reinventing the beverage experience by partnering with trending IPs (intellectual properties), creating exclusive products that resonate with the hearts of younger consumers.</p>

        <p class="n2-text">What is a New-Style Chinese Beverage Brand?</p>
        <img src="images/chagee.jpg" alt="chagee" style="max-width: 30%; height: auto; float: left; margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;"/>
        <p class="n3-text">China's new-style tea drink is a combo of traditional tea culture with modern tech, and it's become super popular in China recently. It's way more innovative than traditional tea drinks, with new raw materials, production processes, product forms, and ways to consume it.
            <br/>They usually use high-quality tea (like oolong, black or green) as the base, along with all sorts of other ingredients like fresh fruits, dairy, plant proteins, and natural spices, to create a whole bunch of different flavours through scientific blending and processing. These drinks use modern equipment and standard processes, with a focus on health and quality. Some brands use cold extraction technology to keep tea's natural aroma and nutrients while reducing the bitter and astringent flavour. New-style tea drinks aren't just classic milk tea and fruit tea, but also milk cover tea, bubble tea, smoothie tea, and other forms, to meet consumers' varied needs for taste and visual experience.</p>
        <p class="n3-text"><br/>Tea drink brands like Heytea, Chagee, Goodme, and so on, often use unique branding, cultural ideas, and marketing strategies to appeal to young consumers. They promote a fashionable and healthy attitude towards life and meet the immediate consumption needs of modern life.
            Tea drinkers are moving away from traditional teahouses and home consumption, and new drinkers are hitting up convenience stores, shopping malls, office buildings and other places. Takeaway platforms are booming as people want their drinks fast. The industry is moving towards 'quality, health and youth', and the market is growing. Tea has become more than just a drink, it's a cultural phenomenon that shows how China's younger generation is mixing tradition with modernity. It's also helping to spread Chinese tea culture around the world.</p>

        <p class="n2-text">The Power of IP Collaborations</p>
        <p class="n3-text">Before exploring the collaboration activities between the IP and beverage shop, we should first be sure about what is the IP. IP (Intellectual Property) originally meant ‘intellectual property’, but in the contemporary commercial and pan-cultural context, its connotation has been expanded to include cultural symbols with cross-media scalability, emotional resonance, and long-term commercial value. According to application scenarios and forms of expression, IP can be divided into the following core types:</p>
        <img src="images/盗墓笔记.jpg" alt="盗墓笔记" style="max-width: 36%; height: auto; float: right; margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;"/>
        <p class="n3-text">1. Content-based IP<br/>Taking the story or worldview as the core, it builds a complete narrative system through literature, film and television, animation, and other carriers, with strong extensibility and user stickiness. For example, story IPs, such as Tomb Raider's Notes and Ghost Blown Lantern, rely on plot tension and character growth to attract audiences; worldview IPs, such as Harry Potter and A Song of Ice and Fire, form an immersive experience through the fictional time and space system and social rules, and the derivative content needs to be in line with the logic of the original setup; and cultural IPs, such as the Forbidden City and Dunhuang, are based on traditional cultural elements, and reconfigure the cultural identity through youthful expression.</p>
        <p class="n3-text">2. Image-based IP<br/>With visual symbols or characters as the core, relying on image recognition rather than complex narratives to drive commercial value. For example, portrait IPs, such as Molly of Pop Mart and Mickey Mouse of Disney, quickly attract users through cute or iconic designs; persona IPs, such as virtual idol Hatsune Miku, maintain their vitality through character labels or fan co-creation.</p>
        <p class="n3-text">3. Functional IP<br/>Oriented to solve specific needs, e.g. brand IP: such as Tmall's cat head symbol, Jingdong's Joy dog, as a figurative carrier of brand values, this type of IP is mostly created by the brand itself.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="n3-text">IP collaborations—whether with anime characters, celebrities, or gaming franchises—are changing the landscape of brand engagement. By collaborating with beloved cultural icons, tea brands can tap into existing fanbases and create highly personalized, limited-edition products. These collaborations bring fresh excitement to the product offering, creating a sense of exclusivity and emotional connection.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <p class="n2-text">Why Young Consumers Are Drawn to Co-Branding</p>
        <p class="n3-text">Co-branding strategies connect young people's love for iconic pop culture with their desire for unique, shareable experiences. IP collaborations are more than just products; they represent an emotional bond. The experience of sipping a drink alongside the excitement of owning a piece of your favorite character or show is unparalleled. For many young consumers, it’s about nostalgia, fandom, and self-expression.
            <br/>The idea behind the partnership between tea brands and IPs is to create emotional connections through the combination of cultural symbols. There are three main types of activities:</p>
        <video style="max-width: 45%; height: auto; float: right; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 3%;" controls>
            <source src="images/沪上阿姨人鱼陷落.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p class="n3-text">1. First, there's the in-depth binding of products and experiences, like launching co-branded limited drinks or integrating IP visual symbols into packaging. The second is creating immersive scenes, like themed shops (the classical space linked to Dream of Red Mansions) or digital interactive technologies such as AR code scanning and voice cup lids, which let consumers 'unlock' IP episodes or characters' voices while drinking tea. Third, there's user participation in derivative games, like collecting badges to exchange for limited peripherals (acrylic plaques of Naixue Tea and The Grandmaster of the Magic Path), launching a collection of second-choice content, and even integrating non-heritage cultural elements into beverage design (Guming's Feitian-themed series with Dunhuang Research Institute), which lets consumers switch from 'buyers' to 'cultural co-creators'.</p>
        <p class="n3-text">2. At the heart of this kind of partnership is a twofold transformation: of emotional value and traffic value. On the one hand, the cultural identity of the IP can elevate tea from functional consumption to 'emotional consumption' - a cup of milk tea with the game character's pattern on it might be seen as a 'payment for love' by fans. For fans, a cup of milk tea with a character from the game can be a 'payment for love', which makes the premium space of the product much more valuable (e.g., the co-branding of 'Love in the Light of the Night' increased the sales of Heytea by 300% in a single day).</p>
        <p class="n3-text">3. On the other hand, co-branding lets you reach new audiences, like when the virtual idol Luo Tianyi teamed up with Mixue, which got the second-generation group's attention. IP also gets the word out through regular use, and it fits well with brands wanting to seem young and modern. IP co-branding is turning consumption on its head. It's not just about the taste; it's also a way for young people to express their identity and be part of the circle culture. So, this combination of 'product + content + experience' could be the key to helping brands breakthrough in this new consumer era.</p>

        <p class="n3-text"><b>Japan’s IP Collaboration Cafés: Third-Party Immersive Experiences</b><br/>
            <br/>Japan's IP-themed cafés, often run by third parties like Animate or Bandai Namco, are all about immersive storytelling and limited-edition merchandise. These cafés, which are linked to anime or gaming franchises, have exclusive menus, character-themed décor, and collectible goods like acrylic stands or postcards. They're usually brand-led and product-centric. Japan's model relies on temporary pop-ups managed by IP licensors or specialty retailers, targeting hardcore fans willing to pay premium prices for unique experiences. For instance, Animate Cafés rotate themes seasonally, leveraging nostalgia and scarcity to drive foot traffic. This approach emphasizes IP loyalty over brand visibility, creating niche cultural hubs rather than mass-market campaigns.</p>

        <p class="n3-text"><b>South Korea’s K-Pop "Café Events": Fandom-Driven Engagement</b><br/>
            <br/>South Korea's birthday cafés for K-pop idols mix fan service with experiential consumption. Fans of famous idols, for instance, from HYBE and SM Entertainment work with cafés to host pop-ups celebrating album releases or member birthdays, offering photo zones, hologram interactions, and themed drinks. These events focus on emotional bonding, allowing fans to "share a moment" with idols virtually. They mix IP with everyday life, and Korea's model is about short-term, event-based engagement, often linked to music milestones. While China's collaborations aim to reach a wide range of people, Korea's birthday cafés focus on making existing fans even more loyal by offering personalized content.</p>

        <p class="n3-text">China's co-branding activity uses IP to give its brands a new lease of life and to appeal to all ages, mixing IP goods with beverage products. Japan's ACG cafés are all about niche fandoms, while Korea's birthday cafés boost the idol economy. All three markets make the most of IP's emotional capital, but China is unique in that it combines daily shopping and dining consumption with youth trends, Japan focuses on collectibility, and Korea is great at meeting fans' needs right away. So, it's clear that regional culture has a big impact on how they make money from IP+"drinks", or say beverages.</p>
